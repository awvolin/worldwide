    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 8/21/23</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Alex Volin ("I") is committed to protecting the privacy of your information. This Privacy Policy describes how I collect, use, and disclose information through my mobile application [Your App Name] (the "App").</p>
    <p>By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>User-Provided Information</h3>
    <p>The only information I collect is what you voluntarily provide to me through the App. This may include information about courts, games, and any other data fields that users may input.</p>
    <h3>iCloud Storage</h3>
    <p>The App utilizes iCloud to store information about courts and games. iCloud is a cloud storage service provided by Apple Inc., and any data stored on iCloud is subject to Apple's privacy practices and policies. I encourage you to review Apple's privacy policy for more information.</p>
    <p>I do not have access to or control over your iCloud account, and I do not collect any information from your device other than what you voluntarily provide within the App.</p>

    <h2>How I Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>I use the information you provide solely for the purpose of enabling the functionality of the App, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Storing and managing information about courts and games on iCloud</li>
        <li>[Any other specific purposes related to the App's functionality]</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I do not share your information with third parties for marketing purposes, nor do I use it for any purpose not expressly described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>I value your trust in providing your personal information to me, and I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect it. However, no method of transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure, and I cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>I may update my Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
